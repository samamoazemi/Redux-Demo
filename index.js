// 3 core concepts in redux :

/* 1. action : 
 actions are a plain JavaScript object that contains information. */

/* 2. reducer : 
 reducers are the pure functions that take the current state and
 action and return the new state and tell the store how to do. */

/* 3. store : 
 The store is the object which holds the state of the application. */
